# AMDNN
## Prerequirement
- [x] Identical output with tensorflow official implementation will ensure the correctness of our implementation.
## TODO LIST
- [x] Set up rollback. (Even program crashed, we could start from last checkpoint)
- [x] Set up walltime limit 48 hours. Every two days, the partial results will be transferred to storage.
- [ ] Mask floating point for Bfloat16 after multiplication.
- [x] T_SIZE should be 0 or 16 bits.
